Statistics & Analysis<br>(1) Import dataset and libraries and quick overview of the data and dataset structure so that checking for and filling the missing values. We will leave the numeric data-types alone and focus on object data-types as what cannot be directly put into a machine learning model. Therefore, we try to give it a discrete value which would help us in prediction and draw a heatmap to clearly see what are the correlations here<br>(2) the predictive goal is to predict Purchase for the customer will be in the store base on other features <br>(3) we try to build a model to predict purchase amount (Purchase column in dataset) from other features.<br>|Xinzhi Huo||5.6-5.19
Regression<br>(1) Select several models to calculate and compare their performance.<br>(2) Regression Training: this is a regression problem and probably we'll use random forest and try Xgboost. We'll choose number of trees (n_estimators) in our forest and max_depth for each tree by calculating scores for each combination and choosing the best one. Scoring metric we'll use is RMSE.<br>(3) Clustering(K-mean):We try and see if we can cluster our customers (User_IDs) based on products they have purchased and other features.We change our features a little bit to be more suitable for clustering. Firstly, we are going to cluster users and not the transactions so we should group our transactions by User_ID and create our features based on that. Then, choose number of clusters (K). We will use elbow method to choose one and plot different distance sums for different number of clusters.| Li ma |Perhaps we will also remove Product_Category_2 and _3 since they have a high rate of null values. Other categorical features have a few number of unique values so we will encode them using One-HotEncode and Product_ID and User_ID which we will encode using LabelEncoder. Then, split our train and test data and will standardize the data using StandardScaler|5.19- 5.30
Classification analysis<br>(1)Use KNN (K Nearest Neighbors) algorithm, SVM (Support Vector Machines), and Decision Trees to classify data into different types.<br>(2) Classification is performed by measuring the distance between different eigenvalues. If a sample has a majority of the k nearest neighbors in the feature space belonging to a certain category, the sample also belongs to this category<br>(3)We will use decision tree algotithm to breaks down the data set into smaller and smaller subsets and gradually develops the relevant decision trees.

Visualization<br>(1) Front-end stylesheet design 5.10-5.20 (Done)<br>* Using LTE template & bootstrap Library to design user-interface. (Done)<br>* Using Echarts Library to design the chart. (Done)<br>* Dynamically modify the display language based on the browser language. (Done)<br> (2) Use Bar-chart & Donut-chart to visualize some interesting data in the analyze module 5.20-5.28<br>(3) Show the prediction result by reading combination data that users input 5.29-6.10 |Zhelin Liang|(1) Do not know how to present the results of data analysis.<br> (2) Do not know the specific content of data analysis|5.10-6.10
